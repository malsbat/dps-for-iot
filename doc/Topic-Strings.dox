@page topic-strings Topic Strings

DPS like other pub/sub protocols expresses publications and
subscriptions as structured text strings called topic strings. A topic
string is a sequence of substrings delineated by a standalone
separator character. In DPS almost any character or set of characters
the publisher and subscriber agree on can be used as a separator. A
publication matches a subscription if the substrings and separators in
the publication are the same as the substrings and separators in the
publication. Subscription topic strings can also include wildcard
characters as described below. These are all valid publication topic
strings:

@verbatim
foo/bar
x,y,z
1.2.3
a/b/c?val=5
@endverbatim

In the last example @c /, @c ?, and @c = are separators. Separators must
standalone, two or more consecutive separators are
disallowed. Subscription topics strings have the same form as
publication topics strings but can include wild-card characters. DPS
uses the same wildcard characters as MQTT with the same meanings: the
plus sign @c + wild card matches to any substring in the same position;
the hash or pound sign @c # matches any number of trailing
substrings. In DPS @c + and @c # are currently the only characters that
are reserved. These are some valid wild-carded subscription topic
strings:

@verbatim
+/bar
x,+,z
1.#
a/b/c?val=+
@endverbatim

In MQTT and other pub/sub protocols a subscription or publication is a
single topic string. A unique feature of DPS is that subscriptions and
publications can have multiple topic strings. A subscription with more
than one topic string will only match publications that have matching
topic strings for all of topic strings in the subscription. As an
example of how this might be used consider a set of devices that
publish a topic string describing device type and a topic string
describing the physical location of the device. An application could
subscribe to all devices at a specific location by only specifying the
location topic string, all devices of a specific type by only
specifying the device type, or home in on a device with a specific
type at specific location by using both topic strings in the same
subscription.  Another unique feature of DPS is that publisher control
over the kinds of wild-card matches a subscriber is permitted to
use. For example, a publisher can decide that wild-card matches must
fully specify at least the first N elements in order to match. This
offers a publisher control over wide-open wildcard subscriptions such
as @c +/#, the most generic form allowed by DPS, that will match any
publication with two or more elements.
