@details
The tutorials provide an introduction into the DPS APIs.  It's
recommended they be read in the order below and assumes some
familiarity with pub/sub terminology.

For compactness, the tutorials use the @c a/b/c/d topic string,
where @c a, @c b, @c c, and @c d are the levels and @c / is the
level separator, and strings for payload data.  A real application
would likely use more meaningful topic strings and structured
payloads.
