/**
@page data-series Data Series

DPS has built-in support for data series. In addition to topic
strings, every publication has a UUID and serial number. Publications
with same UUID (and topic strings) form a series, the serial number is
incremented each time the publication is sent to the network. The UUID
and serial number are available to the receiving subscribers.
