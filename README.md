Distributed Publish & Subscribe for IoT (DPS) is a new protocol that
implements the publish/subscribe (pub/sub) communication pattern.

Devices or applications running the protocol form a dynamic
multiply-connected mesh where each node functions as a message
router. The protocol is light-weight and amenable to implementation on
very small devices such as sensors that primarily publish data. The
architecture is well suited for applications that leverage edge
computing in combination with cloud-based analytics.
